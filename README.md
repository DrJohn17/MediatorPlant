# MediatorPlant
Plant Project mediator pattern

##The Idea of this project was to make use of the robotic arm and a sensor to know when a plant needs water and then let the robot give the water. And to automate this with siple services that can be executed from the cpee.org.

 For this project an orangepi was used.
